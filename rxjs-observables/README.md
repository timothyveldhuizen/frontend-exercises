# RxJS - Reactive extensions library for Javascript
This library is used for reactive programming in Javascript with using Observables.
RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides one core type, the *Observable*, satellite types (*Observer, Schedulers, Subjects*) and operators inspired by *Array* (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.

## Setup

Off course do `npm init` then `npm install --save-dev typescript` for Typescript and `npm install rxjs` on a blank project.
Then `npx tsc --init` to make it a Typescript project and `npx tsc` to compile it to Javascript files.
